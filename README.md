CatapultWars
============

This is a C++/DirectX port of the XNA Catapult Wars tutorial available from MSDN. It's leveraging DirectXTK and tries to mimic the project structure as much as possible.
This is an universal solution with both a Windows and a Windows Phone solution. The rendering is messed up currently!
